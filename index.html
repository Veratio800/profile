        <p>Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small town from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I am the subject of numerous documentaries. My floral arrangements have earned me reknown in international botany circles. I enjoy urban hang gliding. I once read Paradise lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to redecorate the dining room. On Wednesdays, after work, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.</p>
